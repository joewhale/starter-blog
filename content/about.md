## The purpose of this site is to share my experience with sampling cool products and applications.

Hi. My name is Joel Choi, and I love playing with new applications. I'm not technical by any means, and I'm definitely not a great writer. I'm just an average guy that loves products with amazing user interfaces and cool features.

My posts will be all over the place, but I hope to keep it consistent enough with my honest experiences, some step by step tutorials, and reviews/feedback.
