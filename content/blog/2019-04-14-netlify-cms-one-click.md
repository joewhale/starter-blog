After a whole day of researching where I wanted to host this blog about sampling products, I came across a reddit comment that said that Netlify has their own CMS. I had heard of Netlify because I had played around with deploying a Hugo blog a few months ago.

I'm familiar with Squarespace and Wordpress, but I wanted to find something fresh and FREE. Let's be real, I probably am not going to have a lot of traffic on my site.

I clicked around on Netlify CMS and deployed a Hugo theme, but I was a little lost. I knew it deployed, but it was not intuitive on how to use admin settings and start editing pages and posts. I had to google around for a tutorial for idiots.

After looking through the limited options of [Netlify CMS templates](https://templates.netlify.com), I decided go with the Cecil starter blog. It's a simple and clean layout, and the cute butler image was irresistable. With Netlify CMS, you will be required to send admin rights via email and setup your Git workflow via Github. From what I've seen, Netlify CMS will allow you to change your content files and autoamtically push commits to your new Github repository.

Once you're able to access the admin page, you can create your first post. (This post is my first post). The user interface for creating a post is super simple. It's not convulated with unnecessary features. It provides a live preview, and it is clear on how to publish.

Overall a really neat experience to get a blog up and running for free. Time will tell if any updates or weird bugs cause the blog to crash. For now, I'm planning to just type out my thoughts and not mess with any fancy CSS.
